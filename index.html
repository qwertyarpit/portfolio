          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>
            As a web developer, my expertise lies in using technologies such as
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP to create visually appealing,
            responsive and user-friendly websites that effectively communicate
            me and my portfolio.

          <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
          <p>
            Machine learning involves training computer systems to learn from
            data, without being explicitly programmed. My personal portfolio
            includes experience with various machine learning techniques, such
            as supervised and unsupervised learning, and have applied these
            skills to projects in various industries.

          <h3>Competitive Programming</h3>
          <p>
            Competitive programming is the practice of solving algorithmic
            problems in a timed setting, often as part of a contest or
            competition. My personal portfolio includes experience with a
            variety of algorithmic problem-solving techniques and a track record
            of success in competitive programming contests
